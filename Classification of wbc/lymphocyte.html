			Lymphocytes are white blood cells and one of the body’s main types of immune cells. They are made in the bone marrow and found in the blood and lymph tissue.
		</p>
		<p>
			The immune system is a complex network of cells known as immune cells that include lymphocytes. These cells work together to defend the body against foreign substances, such as bacteria, viruses, and cancer cells that can threaten its functioning.
		</p>
		<p>
			A lymphocyte is a type of white blood cell (leukocyte) in the immune system of most vertebrates.[1] Lymphocytes include natural killer cells (which function in cell-mediated, cytotoxic innate immunity), T cells (for cell-mediated, cytotoxic adaptive immunity), and B cells (for humoral, antibody-driven adaptive immunity).[2][3] They are the main type of cell found in lymph, which prompted the name "lymphocyte".[4] Lymphocytes make up between 18% and 42% of circulating white blood cells	
		</p>
		<p>
			In human adults lymphocytes make up roughly 20 to 40 percent of the total number of white blood cells. They are found in the circulation and also are concentrated in central lymphoid organs and tissues, such as the spleen, tonsils, and lymph nodes, where the initial immune response is likely to occur.
		</p>
		<p>
			The two primary types of lymphocytes are B lymphocytes and T lymphocytes, or B cells and T cells. Both originate from stem cells in the bone marrow and are initially similar in appearance. Some lymphocytes migrate to the thymus, where they mature into T cells; others remain in the bone marrow, where—in humans—they develop into B cells. Most lymphocytes are short-lived, with an average life span of a week to a few months, but a few live for years, providing a pool of long-lived T and B cells. These cells account for immunologic “memory,” a more rapid, vigorous response to a second encounter with the same antigen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Through receptor molecules on their surfaces, lymphocytes are able to bind antigens (foreign substances or microorganisms that the host recognizes as “nonself”) and help remove them from the body. Each lymphocyte bears receptors that bind to a specific antigen. The ability to respond to virtually any antigen comes from the enormous variety of lymphocyte populations that the body contains, each of them with a receptor capable of recognizing a unique antigen.
