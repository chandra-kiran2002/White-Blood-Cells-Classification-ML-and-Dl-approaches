			Monocytes are a type of white blood cell (leukocytes) that reside in your blood and tissues to find and destroy germs (viruses, bacteria, fungi and protozoa) and eliminate infected cells. Monocytes call on other white blood cells to help treat injury and prevent infection.
		</p>
		<p>
			Monocytes are your cell’s firefighters. Their lifecycle begins in the bone marrow (soft tissue inside of your bones) where they grow and train to protect your body. Once they mature, they enter your bloodstream and tissues to defend your body against foreign invaders, like germs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Monocytes are the largest type of white blood cell and are nearly twice the size of a red blood cell. Under a microscope, monocytes are easy to identify based on their size. Monocyte cells have a two-bodied nucleus (bilobed nuclei) center that floats in a contained fluid called cytoplasm.A lab technician will add a stain to better view the cells under a microscope, which turns the components of the cell a pale to dark blue and purple color. Within the cytoplasm are tiny grain-like granules that may appear light purple. The nucleus changes shapes as the cell moves throughout your body.		</p>
		<p>
			Monocytes form in the soft tissue of your bones (bone marrow). After the cells mature, they travel to your tissues where they defend your body from infection alongside other cells in your immune system.
		</p>
		<p>
			Conditions vary based on the number of monocytes in your blood. Your monocyte count can be too high or too low as a result of your body fighting an infection or disease.		</p>
		<p>
			A normal monocyte count is between 2% and 8% of your white blood cell count. This equals about 200 to 800 monocytes per microliter of blood in healthy adults. If your monocyte count is outside those ranges, you're at risk of acquiring a monocyte-related condition.
