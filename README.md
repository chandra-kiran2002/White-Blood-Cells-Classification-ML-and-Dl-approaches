This repository contains code and resources for a 4-class classification task of white blood cells. The objective is to classify white blood cell images into four different classes based on their morphology.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this classification task consists of images of white blood cells, with each image belonging to one of the following four classes:

1. Neutrophils
2. Lymphocytes
3. Monocytes
4. Eosinophils

Please note that the dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, instructions for obtaining the dataset are provided in the "Data" section below.

## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow (version >= 2.0)
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- OpenCV
- Jupyter Notebook (optional, for running the provided notebook)

## Getting Started
1. First, make sure you have all the dependencies mentioned above installed on your system.
2. Next, obtain the dataset as per the instructions provided in the "Data" section.
3. Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
