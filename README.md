This repository contains code and resources for a 4-class classification task of white blood cells. The objective is to classify white blood cell images into four different classes based on their morphology.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this classification task consists of images of white blood cells, with each image belonging to one of the following four classes:

1. Neutrophils
2. Lymphocytes
3. Monocytes
4. Eosinophils

Please note that the dataset is not included in this repository due to its large size. However, instructions for obtaining the dataset are provided in the "Data" section below.
